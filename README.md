# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic Tac Toe is a simple, two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The game is played between two players, X and O, who take turns marking a square on the board. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw. The game requires strategic thinking and is a great introduction to game development and problem-solving..

Project Overview
The Tic Tac Toe project is a simple command-line game developed in Python. The game allows two players, X and O, to play against each other. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid, and players take turns marking a square on the board. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

Complexities Faced
During the development of this project, I faced the following complexities:

Game Logic: Implementing the game logic to check for wins, draws, and valid moves was a challenge. I had to ensure that the game correctly identified winning conditions and prevented players from making invalid moves.
User Input: Handling user input was another challenge. I had to ensure that the program correctly parsed user input and updated the game board accordingly.
Error Handling: I had to implement error handling to handle cases where users entered invalid input, such as trying to place a mark on a square that was already occupied.
Outcomes
The outcome of this project is a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game that can be played in the command line. The game is easy to use, and players can easily navigate the game board.

What I Learned
After completing this project, I learned the following:

Game Development: I gained experience in developing a simple game in Python, including implementing game logic, handling user input, and error handling.
Problem-Solving: I improved my problem-solving skills by breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts and implementing solutions.
Code Organization: I learned the importance of organizing code in a logical and structured manner, making it easier to maintain and update.
I hope this provides a good overview of my Tic Tac Toe project! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to elaborate on any aspect of the project.
